Siddiq is an undergraduate at Oriel College, Oxford.\n\nRomy Williamson - Rubik's Cube:\nThis is a Rubik’s cube of my own design. It’s made from 156 squares of paper, and other things I had on my desk. The Rubik’s cube is a popular example of Group Theory in real life.\n\nThe set of all ways to assemble a cube from the Rubik’s cube pieces has cardinality (12!)(2^12)(8!)(3^8) because there are 12 edge pieces each with 2 possible orientations, and 8 corner pieces each with 3 possible orientations. However, many of these configurations are impossible to reach by turning a solved cube. So the actual Rubik’s cube group has “only” (12!)(2^10)(8!)(3^7)=43,252,003,274,489,856,000 elements.\n\nRomy Williamson is an undergraduate at Merton College, Oxford.\n\nMartin Parker - Diffusion limited aggregation:\nDiffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) is a random fractal object created by repeatedly simulating random walks (‘diffusing particles’). It is a topic of great mathematical and physical interest. For this multimedia piece, DLA was simulated on a line and the heights of the particles in the object were then converted into musical notes which can be heard on a synthesiser. The video is a visualisation of the music (it does not represent how the object was grown). The work is inspired by the piece ‘dendritic’ (https://www.multiverseseries.org/blog/dendritic).\n\nMartin Parker is an undergraduate at St Catherine's College, Oxford.\n\nAidan Strong - Bach Crab Canon\nHere I play one of the canons from Bach's 'Musical Offering', which is one of Bach's most complex and mathematical works. The musical offering is filled with devices such as canons, augmentations, and retrogrades, each of which can be thought of as translations, stretches, and reflections of the music in the time axis respectively. In this canon, the 18 bar theme is played against itself but in reverse, so when the full 18 bars are played in reverse, it sounds the same - i.e. there is symmetry about the time axis!\n\nAidan Strong is an undergraduate at Lincoln College, Oxford.\n\nSam Palmer - Polyrhythms\nPolyrhythms are a rare gem in music. They appear in a range of contexts from Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody to tribal African music. Polyrhythm refers to multiple rhythms happening at the same time, for example having one melody playing three beats per bar while another melody plays four beats in the same bar. This is a little melody I wrote where most of the time the bass notes are playing in three time and the high notes are in four time.\n\nSam Palmer is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Mathematical Institute in Oxford.\n\nAndrew Krause - Pattern Forming Snake\nJames Murray's Mathematical Biology textbook discussed a model of cell movement (chemotaxis) plausibly underlying the formation of patterns on the skin of snakes. In the embryonic stage when these patterns form, the snakes are already coiled. The book states, \"although it would be more realistic to study the model mechanism on the surface of a coiled cylindrical domain, the numerical simulation difficulties were already considerable even on a plane domain.\"\n\nThis is such a simulation not feasible in the 1980s. Rather than stationary patterns, we see continuous movement of cells. It took about an hour of computing in 2021.\n \nAndrew Krause is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Mathematical Institute in Oxford.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8eW4LFH_b8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8eW4LFH_b8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8eW4LFH_b8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8eW4LFH_b8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A8eW4LFH_b8/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Oxford Mathematics","tags":["Maths and Video","Oxford Mathematics","Rubik's Cube","Maths and Music","Chemotaxis","Diffusion Limited Aggregation","J.S.

I tried saying it two different ways and we accidentally left both in the edit. So, let's call that 'buy one get one free' sale on learning.\n- At 21:42 I say \"geometric mean\" instead of \"arithmetic mean\". And that is probably not the only time. These words have lost all meaning to me.\n- The Patreon credits stop early! Long story.

Sorry! It broke when the video was render and because it was only in the middle I didn't spot it once it had uploaded.\n- At 07:45 I imply that you might start dealing from the bottom of the deck (obviously I would never dream of such a thing).

It is there because your dm is negative that your rocket is losing mass.

But then at the end you are again substituting on the equation. The resulting equation is correct but that minus sign is there not because of v_e. It is there because your dm is negative that your rocket is losing mass. So should be placed in derivation.\"\n- Let me know if you spot any other mistakes!\n\nThanks to my Patreons whose generous funding I used for a vacation to Cocoa Beech Florida NO REFUNDS.\n\n(Or maybe everyone involved donated their time, covered their own expenses and my Patreons only had to pay for that flip-chart.

Spotted by macronencer. \n- Yes, I had “refor” above instead of “reform”. Another meta-correction!\n- Let me know if you spot anything else. Preferably in the video and not the corrections.\n\n\nThanks to my Patreon supports who do support these videos and make them possible.

The UK system for dealing with ties is unfair!\n\nJen and I do Maths Inspiration shows together.\nhttp://www.mathsinspiration.com/\n\nWe’re out doing The Curious Coincidence of Maths in the Daytime in Melbourne next February.\nhttps://www.artscentremelbourne.com.au/whats-on/2018/education/curious-maths-in-the-day-time\n\n\nResults from Judges votes Saturday 2 December 2017\n\nJoint first: Alexandra & Gorka\nJoint first: Debbie & Giovanni\nSecond place: Joe & Katya\nThird place: Mollie & AJ\nJoint last: Gemma & Aljaž\nJoint last: Davood & Nadiya\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/strictlycomedancing/entries/34fb3f42-2210-4080-a01f-962719269386\n\nAfter being combined with the audience rankings the bottom two were Alexandra & Gorka and Davood & Nadiya. But if the ties were done properly that could have been Gemma & Aljaž instead of Alexandra & Gorka.\n\nIf you have a way to get us the data from the BBC, send me an anonymous email! matt@standupmaths.com\n\nCORRECTIONS:\n- Shimassi and others have made very important points about how this system favours the public vote. Because a tie means the judges accidentally give extra points to the contestants they’re trying to rank at the bottom.\n\nThis is my fault for not being clear enough. When we said things like “skewing it towards the judges” and “inflating the judges’s score” we are talking about there being more points being given. Not that the judges were getting their way. Sorry I did a bad job of talking about that and my language was not precise enough.\n\nJen’s main example was that the contestant ranked top by the judges was unfairly moved to the bottom two (and into the dance-off) because the public got their way.\n\nIn short: the audience can always penalise someone by given them one vote, the judges can’t always do that.\n\nAnother interesting fairness metric is that someone top-ranked by the judges and bottom-ranked by the audience should be exactly equal to someone bottom-ranked by the judges and top-ranked by the public. But if there is a tie for the judges the audience choice gets an unfair advantage.\n\n- Others have pointed out (and David Heath sent a great email to me) that Strictly once had a system like what we describe but they got into trouble because people were paying to phone in and vote for a contestant when it was mathematically impossible for them to be voted out of the dance-off.

The UK system for dealing with ties is unfair!\n\nJen and I do Maths Inspiration shows together.\nhttp://www.mathsinspiration.com/\n\nWe’re out doing The Curious Coincidence of Maths in the Daytime in Melbourne next February.\nhttps://www.artscentremelbourne.com.au/whats-on/2018/education/curious-maths-in-the-day-time\n\n\nResults from Judges votes Saturday 2 December 2017\n\nJoint first: Alexandra & Gorka\nJoint first: Debbie & Giovanni\nSecond place: Joe & Katya\nThird place: Mollie & AJ\nJoint last: Gemma & Aljaž\nJoint last: Davood & Nadiya\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/strictlycomedancing/entries/34fb3f42-2210-4080-a01f-962719269386\n\nAfter being combined with the audience rankings the bottom two were Alexandra & Gorka and Davood & Nadiya. But if the ties were done properly that could have been Gemma & Aljaž instead of Alexandra & Gorka.\n\nIf you have a way to get us the data from the BBC, send me an anonymous email! matt@standupmaths.com\n\nCORRECTIONS:\n- Shimassi and others have made very important points about how this system favours the public vote. Because a tie means the judges accidentally give extra points to the contestants they’re trying to rank at the bottom.\n\nThis is my fault for not being clear enough. When we said things like “skewing it towards the judges” and “inflating the judges’s score” we are talking about there being more points being given. Not that the judges were getting their way. Sorry I did a bad job of talking about that and my language was not precise enough.\n\nJen’s main example was that the contestant ranked top by the judges was unfairly moved to the bottom two (and into the dance-off) because the public got their way.\n\nIn short: the audience can always penalise someone by given them one vote, the judges can’t always do that.\n\nAnother interesting fairness metric is that someone top-ranked by the judges and bottom-ranked by the audience should be exactly equal to someone bottom-ranked by the judges and top-ranked by the public. But if there is a tie for the judges the audience choice gets an unfair advantage.\n\n- Others have pointed out (and David Heath sent a great email to me) that Strictly once had a system like what we describe but they got into trouble because people were paying to phone in and vote for a contestant when it was mathematically impossible for them to be voted out of the dance-off. And the BBC can’t have a phone-in competition if some votes cannot make a difference.\n\nThis makes for an interesting set of criteria. The voting system needs to be fair, easy to explain to a TV audience and the audience vote is always able to move any given contestant out of the bottom two.\n\n\nThanks to my Patreon supporters who made this possible.

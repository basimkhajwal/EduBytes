Namely, if the probabilities for each value in a given range (of the real number line) are all non-zero, no matter how small, their sum will be infinite.  This isn't immediately obvious, given that you can have convergent sums of countable infinitely many values, but if you're up for it see if you can prove that the sum of any uncountable infinite collection of positive values must blow up to infinity.\n\n------------------\r\n\r\nThese animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim\r\n\r\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.\r\n\r\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\r\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\r\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\r\n\r\nStream the music on Spotify:\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".

This does require some background in real analysis, but if you want to dig in, here is a textbook by the always great Terence Tao.\nhttps://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/measure-book1.pdf\n\nAlso, for the real analysis buffs among you, there was one statement I made in this video that is a rather nice puzzle.  Namely, if the probabilities for each value in a given range (of the real number line) are all non-zero, no matter how small, their sum will be infinite.  This isn't immediately obvious, given that you can have convergent sums of countable infinitely many values, but if you're up for it see if you can prove that the sum of any uncountable infinite collection of positive values must blow up to infinity.\n\n------------------\r\n\r\nThese animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim\r\n\r\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.\r\n\r\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\r\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\r\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\r\n\r\nStream the music on Spotify:\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".

product more deeply, this video shows how it relates to a certain linear transformation via duality.  This perspective gives a very elegant explanation of why the traditional computation of a dot product corresponds to its geometric interpretation.\n\n*Note, in all the computations here, I list the coordinates of the vectors as columns of a matrix, but many textbooks put them in the rows of a matrix instead.  It makes no difference for the result since the determinant is unchanged after a transpose, but given how I've framed most of this series I think it is more intuitive to go with a column-centric approach.\n\nFull series: http://3b1b.co/eola\n\nFuture series like this are funded by the community, through Patreon, where supporters get early access as the series is being produced.\nhttp://3b1b.co/support\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

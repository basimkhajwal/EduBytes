It comes in the form of a recursion formula that connects the different numbers of bits and pieces in consecutive dimensions. That recursion formula is also present at the bottom of the \"iron man page\". Have a close look :) Also, in the Marvel movies the cube that Tony Stark is holding in the thumbnail of this video is called the Tesseract. Probably worth pointing out that \"tesseract\" is another name for a 4-d cube. I also built an easter egg into the thumbnail that plays on this fact:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/psIy28k \n\nThe formulae for n-d tetrahedra and octahedra can be found on this page;  \n\nhttps://people.math.osu.edu/fiedorowicz.1/math655/HyperEuler.html\n\nHere is a link to my video on solving the 4d Hyper Rubik's Cube\n\nhttps://youtu.be/yhPH1369OWc\n\nAnother proof of Moessner for cubes using cubical shells Anthony Harradine and Anita Ponsaing\n\nhttps://www.qedcat.com/StrikeMeOut.pdf\n\nHere is a really nice video on the 120-cell that I only mentioned in passing.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MFXRRW9goTs\n\nNoteworthy from the comments:\nToday's video was \"triggered\" by a comment made by Godfrey Pigott on the last video on Moessner's miracle in which he pointed out that (x+2)^n  captures the vital statistics of the n-dimensional cube.\n\nZ. Michael Gehlke There is an easy way to see this: (x^1 + 2*x^0) describes the parts of a line; all of the cubes are iterated products of lines: n-cube = (1-cube)^n. Therefore, all cubes are described by iterated powers of (x^1 + 2*x^0)^n. (Me: Nice insight. Of course needs some fleshing out to make this work on it's own, like in the comment by ...\n\nHEHEHE I AM A SUPAHSTAR SAGA I came up with an even simpler visual proof. Take a cube of side length x+2. This cube has a volume (x+2)^3. Now, slice the cube six times. Each slicing plane is parallel to a face and 1 unit deeper than the face. Don't throw away any volume. What you're left with is an inner cube of side length x (volume x^3), 6 square pieces of volume x^2, 12 edge pieces of volume x, and 8 corner cubes with volume 1 each.

It comes in the form of a recursion formula that connects the different numbers of bits and pieces in consecutive dimensions. That recursion formula is also present at the bottom of the \"iron man page\". Have a close look :) Also, in the Marvel movies the cube that Tony Stark is holding in the thumbnail of this video is called the Tesseract. Probably worth pointing out that \"tesseract\" is another name for a 4-d cube.

Michael Gehlke There is an easy way to see this: (x^1 + 2*x^0) describes the parts of a line; all of the cubes are iterated products of lines: n-cube = (1-cube)^n. Therefore, all cubes are described by iterated powers of (x^1 + 2*x^0)^n. (Me: Nice insight. Of course needs some fleshing out to make this work on it's own, like in the comment by ...\n\nHEHEHE I AM A SUPAHSTAR SAGA I came up with an even simpler visual proof. Take a cube of side length x+2. This cube has a volume (x+2)^3. Now, slice the cube six times. Each slicing plane is parallel to a face and 1 unit deeper than the face. Don't throw away any volume. What you're left with is an inner cube of side length x (volume x^3), 6 square pieces of volume x^2, 12 edge pieces of volume x, and 8 corner cubes with volume 1 each. Adding up these volumes gives you the original (x+2)^3 volume, so it's proven.

Another long one :)  In fact, a new record in terms of the slideshow: 547 slides! \n\nThis video is about one or my all-time favourite theorems in math(s): Euler's amazing pentagonal number theorem, it's unexpected connection to a prime number detector, the crazy infinite refinement of the Fibonacci growth rule into a growth rule for the partition numbers, etc. All math(s) mega star material, featuring guest appearances by Ramanujan, Hardy and Rademacher, and the \"first substantial\" American theorem by Fabian Franklin.\n\n00:00 Intro\n02:39 Chapter 1: Warmup\n05:29 Chapter 2: Partition numbers can be deceiving\n16:19 Chapter 3: Euler's twisted machine\n20:19 Chapter 4: Triangular, square and pentagonal numbers\n24:35 Chapter 5: The Ramanujan-Hardy-Rademacher formula\n29:27 Chapter 6: Euler's pentagonal number theorem (proof part 1)\n42:00 Chapter 7: Euler's machine (proof part 2)\n50:00 Credits\n\nHere are some links and other references if you interested in digging deeper. \n\nThis is the paper by Bjorn Poonen and Michael Rubenstein about the 1 2 4 8 16 30 sequence: http://www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/ngon.pdf\n\nThe nicest introduction to integer partitions I know of is this book by George E. Andrews and Kimmo Eriksson - Integer Partitions (2004, Cambridge University Press) The generating function free visual proofs in the last two chapters of this vides were inspired by the chapter on the pentagonal number theorem in this book and the set of exercises following it.\n\nSome very nice online write-ups featuring the usual generating function magic:\nDick Koch (uni Oregon) https://tinyurl.com/yxe3nch3\n\nJames Tanton (MAA) https://tinyurl.com/y5xj2dmb\n\nA timeline of Euler's discovery of all the maths that I touch upon in this video: \nhttps://imgur.com/a/Ko3mnDi\n\nCheck out the translation of one of Euler's papers (about the \"modified\" machine): \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y5wlmtgb\n\nEuler's paper talks about the \"modified machine\" as does Tanton in the last part of his write-up. \n\nAnother nice insight about the tweaked machine: a positive integer is called “perfect” if all its factors sum except for the largest factor sum to the number (6, 28, 496, ...). This means that we can also use the tweaked machine as a perfect number detector :) \n\nEnjoy!\n\nBurkard\n\nToday's bug report: \nI got the formula for the number of regions slightly wrong in the video. It needs to be adjusted by +n. In their paper Poonen and Rubenstein count the number of regions that a regular n-gon is divided into by their diagonals.

Another long one :)  In fact, a new record in terms of the slideshow: 547 slides! \n\nThis video is about one or my all-time favourite theorems in math(s): Euler's amazing pentagonal number theorem, it's unexpected connection to a prime number detector, the crazy infinite refinement of the Fibonacci growth rule into a growth rule for the partition numbers, etc. All math(s) mega star material, featuring guest appearances by Ramanujan, Hardy and Rademacher, and the \"first substantial\" American theorem by Fabian Franklin.\n\n00:00 Intro\n02:39 Chapter 1: Warmup\n05:29 Chapter 2: Partition numbers can be deceiving\n16:19 Chapter 3: Euler's twisted machine\n20:19 Chapter 4: Triangular, square and pentagonal numbers\n24:35 Chapter 5: The Ramanujan-Hardy-Rademacher formula\n29:27 Chapter 6: Euler's pentagonal number theorem (proof part 1)\n42:00 Chapter 7: Euler's machine (proof part 2)\n50:00 Credits\n\nHere are some links and other references if you interested in digging deeper. \n\nThis is the paper by Bjorn Poonen and Michael Rubenstein about the 1 2 4 8 16 30 sequence: http://www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/ngon.pdf\n\nThe nicest introduction to integer partitions I know of is this book by George E. Andrews and Kimmo Eriksson - Integer Partitions (2004, Cambridge University Press) The generating function free visual proofs in the last two chapters of this vides were inspired by the chapter on the pentagonal number theorem in this book and the set of exercises following it.\n\nSome very nice online write-ups featuring the usual generating function magic:\nDick Koch (uni Oregon) https://tinyurl.com/yxe3nch3\n\nJames Tanton (MAA) https://tinyurl.com/y5xj2dmb\n\nA timeline of Euler's discovery of all the maths that I touch upon in this video: \nhttps://imgur.com/a/Ko3mnDi\n\nCheck out the translation of one of Euler's papers (about the \"modified\" machine): \nhttps://tinyurl.com/y5wlmtgb\n\nEuler's paper talks about the \"modified machine\" as does Tanton in the last part of his write-up. \n\nAnother nice insight about the tweaked machine: a positive integer is called “perfect” if all its factors sum except for the largest factor sum to the number (6, 28, 496, ...). This means that we can also use the tweaked machine as a perfect number detector :) \n\nEnjoy!\n\nBurkard\n\nToday's bug report: \nI got the formula for the number of regions slightly wrong in the video. It needs to be adjusted by +n. In their paper Poonen and Rubenstein count the number of regions that a regular n-gon is divided into by their diagonals. So this formula misses out on the n regions that have a circle segment as one of their boundaries.\n\nThe two pieces of music that I've used in this video are 'Tis the season and First time experience by Nate Blaze, both from the free YouTube audio library.\n\nAs I said in the video, today's t-shirt is brand new.

The First World War had started some time ago. I had in my hand a copy of the monthly Strand Magazine which at that time used to publish a number of puzzles to be solved by the readers. Ramanujan was stir­ring something in a pan over the fire for our lunch. I was sitting near the table, turning over the pages of the Strand Magazine. I got interested in a problem involving a rela­tion between two numbers. I have forgotten the details but I remember the type of the problem. Two British offi­cers had been billeted in Paris in two different houses in a long street; the two numbers of these houses were related in a special way; the problem was to find out the two numbers. It was not at all difficult; I got the solution in a few minutes by trial and error. In a joking way, I told Ramanujan, 'Now here is a problem for you'. He said, 'What problem, tell me', and went on stirring the pan. I read out the question from the Strand Magazine. He promptly answered 'Please take down the solution' and dictated a continued fraction. The first term was the solu­tion which I had obtained. Each successive term repre­sented successive solutions for the same type of relation between two numbers, as the number of houses in the street would increase indefinitely. I was amazed and I asked him how he got the solution in a flash. He said, 'Immediately I heard the problem it was clear that the solution should obviously be a continued fraction; I then thought, which continued fraction? And the answer came to my mind. It was just as simple as this.' \"\n\nThere is a complete digital archive of The Strand magazine. You can find the page with the puzzle here: https://tinyurl.com/y2lnb8xf (page 790) \n\nIf you read the puzzle in the Strand you'll find that the problem is actually phrased somewhat differently to what Mahalanobis remembers and Mahalanobis also does not spell out the infinite fraction that Ramanujan came up with. And if you do the math(s) some of the other things he says also don't quite sound right. What I am presenting in this video is my best guess for what really happened.\n\nIn particular, the continued fraction that I am talking about in video is probably the most natural candidate for Ramanujan's infinite fraction, but others have argued that it could have been a different continued fraction (which I don't buy :) You can find these other infinite fractions here: 'Ramanujan's Continued Fraction for a Puzzle\" by Poo-Sung Park https://tinyurl.com/yyfdscgr and here 'On Ramanujan, continued fractions and an interesting street number' by John Butcher https://tinyurl.com/yy6nv2yg\n\nSolution to the red cross puzzle from Dudeney's book \"Amusements in Mathematics\" p. 168  :) https://imgur.com/a/bBuLOZN\n\nAnother interesting way to systematically search for solutions to the Strand puzzle is this: The equation we want to solve is 2 x^2=y^2+y.

Here are a few of the most noteworthy observations so far:\n- Based on feedback by one of you it looks like it was the Russian math teacher and math olympiad coach Alexander Spivak discovered the windmill interpretation of Zagier's proof; see also the link in the description of this video.\n- Challenge 1 at the very end should (of course :) be: an integer can be written as a difference of two squares if and only if it is odd or a multiple of 4.\n-one of you actually ran some primality testing to make sure that that 100 digit number is really a prime. Based on those tests it's looking good that this is indeed the case :)\n- one of you actually found this !!! 6513516734600035718300327211250928237178281758494417357560086828416863929270451437126021949850746381 = 16120430216983125661219096041413890639183535175875^2 + 79080013051462081144097259373611263341866969255266^2\n- a nice insight about the windmill proof for Pythagoras's theorem is that you can shift the two tilings with respect to each other and you get different dissection proofs this way. Particularly nice ones result when you place the vertices of the large square at the centres of the smaller squares :)\n- proving that there is only one straight square cross: observe that the five pieces of the cross can be lined up into a long rectangle with short side is x. Since the area of the rectangle is the prime p, x has to be 1. Very pretty :)\n- Mathologer videos covering the ticked beautiful proofs in the math beauty pageant:\ne^i pi=-1 : https://youtu.be/-dhHrg-KbJ0 (there are actually a couple of videos in which I talk about this but this is the main one)\ninfinitely many primes: Mentioned a couple of times: This video has a really fun proof off the beaten track:https://youtu.be/LFwSIdLSosI\npi^2/6: Again mentioned a couple of times but this one here is the main video: https://youtu.be/yPl64xi_ZZA\nroot 2 is irrational: one of the videos in which I present a proof: https://youtu.be/f1yDExNAEMg\npi is transcendental: https://youtu.be/9gk_8mQuerg\nAnd actually there is one more on the list, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem that is a corollary of of what I do in this video: https://youtu.be/7s-YM-kcKME\n- When you start with the 11k windmill and then alternate swapping yz and the footprint construction, you'll start cycling through  different windmill solutions and will eventually reach one of the solutions we are really interested in.

Here are a few of the most noteworthy observations so far:\n- Based on feedback by one of you it looks like it was the Russian math teacher and math olympiad coach Alexander Spivak discovered the windmill interpretation of Zagier's proof; see also the link in the description of this video.\n- Challenge 1 at the very end should (of course :) be: an integer can be written as a difference of two squares if and only if it is odd or a multiple of 4.\n-one of you actually ran some primality testing to make sure that that 100 digit number is really a prime. Based on those tests it's looking good that this is indeed the case :)\n- one of you actually found this !!! 6513516734600035718300327211250928237178281758494417357560086828416863929270451437126021949850746381 = 16120430216983125661219096041413890639183535175875^2 + 79080013051462081144097259373611263341866969255266^2\n- a nice insight about the windmill proof for Pythagoras's theorem is that you can shift the two tilings with respect to each other and you get different dissection proofs this way. Particularly nice ones result when you place the vertices of the large square at the centres of the smaller squares :)\n- proving that there is only one straight square cross: observe that the five pieces of the cross can be lined up into a long rectangle with short side is x. Since the area of the rectangle is the prime p, x has to be 1. Very pretty :)\n- Mathologer videos covering the ticked beautiful proofs in the math beauty pageant:\ne^i pi=-1 : https://youtu.be/-dhHrg-KbJ0 (there are actually a couple of videos in which I talk about this but this is the main one)\ninfinitely many primes: Mentioned a couple of times: This video has a really fun proof off the beaten track:https://youtu.be/LFwSIdLSosI\npi^2/6: Again mentioned a couple of times but this one here is the main video: https://youtu.be/yPl64xi_ZZA\nroot 2 is irrational: one of the videos in which I present a proof: https://youtu.be/f1yDExNAEMg\npi is transcendental: https://youtu.be/9gk_8mQuerg\nAnd actually there is one more on the list, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem that is a corollary of of what I do in this video: https://youtu.be/7s-YM-kcKME\n- When you start with the 11k windmill and then alternate swapping yz and the footprint construction, you'll start cycling through  different windmill solutions and will eventually reach one of the solutions we are really interested in.

Two ways to support Mathologer \nMathologer Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/mathologer\nMathologer PayPal: paypal.me/mathologer\n(see the Patreon page for details)\n\nThis video is about the absolutely wonderful wobbly table theorem. A special case of this theorem became well-known in 2014 when Numberphile dedicated a video to it: A wobbling square table can often be fixed by turning it on the spot. \n\nToday I'll show you why and to what extent this trick works, not only for square tables but also general rectangular ones. I'll also let you in on the interesting history of this theorem and I'll tell you how a couple of friends and I turned the ingenious heuristic argument for why stabilising-by- turning should work into a proper mathematical theorem.\n\nHere is a link to a preprint of the article by Bill Baritompa, Rainer Löwen, Marty Ross and me that I refer to in the video: http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0511490 .

A special case of this theorem became well-known in 2014 when Numberphile dedicated a video to it: A wobbling square table can often be fixed by turning it on the spot. \n\nToday I'll show you why and to what extent this trick works, not only for square tables but also general rectangular ones. I'll also let you in on the interesting history of this theorem and I'll tell you how a couple of friends and I turned the ingenious heuristic argument for why stabilising-by- turning should work into a proper mathematical theorem.\n\nHere is a link to a preprint of the article by Bill Baritompa, Rainer Löwen, Marty Ross and me that I refer to in the video: http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0511490 .

Two ways to support Mathologer \nMathologer Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/mathologer\nMathologer PayPal: paypal.me/mathologer\n(see the Patreon page for details)\n\nThis video is about Fermat's last theorem and Euler's conjecture,  a vast but not very well-known generalisation of this super theorem. Featuring guest appearances by Homer Simpson and the legendary supercomputer CDC6600. The video splits into a fairly easygoing first part and a hardcore second part which is dedicated to presenting my take on the simplest proof of the simplest case of Fermat's last theorem: A^4 +B^4=C^4 has no solution in positive integers A, B, C. \n\nThe proof in question is taken from the book Lectures on elliptic curves by J.W.S. Cassels (pages 55 and 56). Here is a scan of the relevant bits: http://www.qedcat.com/misc/cassels_proof.pdf  This writeup of the proof actually contains a few little typos, can you find them? In the video I attribute the proof to John Cassels the author of this book because I've never seen it anywhere else. It's certainly not Fermat's proof as one may be led to believe reading Cassel's writeup of this proof.\nThe Wiki page on Euler's conjecture contains a good summary of the known results and a good list of references: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_sum_of_powers_conjecture\nThere is one aspect of this conjecture that I did not go into in the video. The conjecture says that for n greater than 2 at least n nth positive integer powers are necessary to make another nth integer power. On the other hand, it is not known whether for every such n there is an example of n nth powers summing to another nth power.

Featuring guest appearances by Homer Simpson and the legendary supercomputer CDC6600. The video splits into a fairly easygoing first part and a hardcore second part which is dedicated to presenting my take on the simplest proof of the simplest case of Fermat's last theorem: A^4 +B^4=C^4 has no solution in positive integers A, B, C. \n\nThe proof in question is taken from the book Lectures on elliptic curves by J.W.S. Cassels (pages 55 and 56). Here is a scan of the relevant bits: http://www.qedcat.com/misc/cassels_proof.pdf  This writeup of the proof actually contains a few little typos, can you find them? In the video I attribute the proof to John Cassels the author of this book because I've never seen it anywhere else. It's certainly not Fermat's proof as one may be led to believe reading Cassel's writeup of this proof.\nThe Wiki page on Euler's conjecture contains a good summary of the known results and a good list of references: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_sum_of_powers_conjecture\nThere is one aspect of this conjecture that I did not go into in the video. The conjecture says that for n greater than 2 at least n nth positive integer powers are necessary to make another nth integer power. On the other hand, it is not known whether for every such n there is an example of n nth powers summing to another nth power. In fact, even my example of a sum of five 5th powers summing to another 5th power in the video was not known to Euler.

It is due to the Swiss mathematician Johann Lambert who published it over 250 years ago. \n\nThe original write-up by Lambert is 58 pages long and definitely not for the faint of heart (http://www.kuttaka.org/~JHL/L1768b.pdf).  On the other hand, among all the proofs of the irrationality of pi, Lambert's proof is probably the most \"natural\" one, the one that's easiest to motivate and explain, and one that's ideally suited for the sort of animations that I do. \n\nAnyway it's been an absolute killer to put this video together and overall this is probably the most ambitious topic I've tackled so far. I really hope that a lot of you will get something out of it. If you do please let me know :) Also, as usual, please consider contributing subtitles in your native language (English and Russian are under control, but everything else goes). \n\nOne of the best short versions of Lambert's proof is contained in the book Autour du nombre pi by Jean-Pierre Lafon and Pierre Eymard. In particular, in it the authors calculate an explicit formula for the n-th partial fraction of Lambert's tan x formula; here is a scan with some highlighting by me: http://www.qedcat.com/misc/chopped.png\nHave a close look and you'll see that as n goes to infinity all the highlighted terms approach 1. What's left are the Maclaurin series for sin x on top and that for cos x at the bottom and this then goes a long way towards showing that those partial fractions really tend to tan x.\n\nThere is a good summary of other proofs for the irrationality of pi on this wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_π_is_irrational\n\nToday's main t-shirt I got from from Zazzle: \nhttps://www.zazzle.com.au/25_dec_31_oct_t_shirt-235809979886007646\n(there are lots of places that sell \"HO cubed\" t-shirts) \n \nlf you liked this video maybe also consider checking out some of my other videos on irrational and transcendental numbers and on continued fractions and other infinite expressions.

It is due to the Swiss mathematician Johann Lambert who published it over 250 years ago. \n\nThe original write-up by Lambert is 58 pages long and definitely not for the faint of heart (http://www.kuttaka.org/~JHL/L1768b.pdf).  On the other hand, among all the proofs of the irrationality of pi, Lambert's proof is probably the most \"natural\" one, the one that's easiest to motivate and explain, and one that's ideally suited for the sort of animations that I do. \n\nAnyway it's been an absolute killer to put this video together and overall this is probably the most ambitious topic I've tackled so far. I really hope that a lot of you will get something out of it. If you do please let me know :) Also, as usual, please consider contributing subtitles in your native language (English and Russian are under control, but everything else goes). \n\nOne of the best short versions of Lambert's proof is contained in the book Autour du nombre pi by Jean-Pierre Lafon and Pierre Eymard. In particular, in it the authors calculate an explicit formula for the n-th partial fraction of Lambert's tan x formula; here is a scan with some highlighting by me: http://www.qedcat.com/misc/chopped.png\nHave a close look and you'll see that as n goes to infinity all the highlighted terms approach 1. What's left are the Maclaurin series for sin x on top and that for cos x at the bottom and this then goes a long way towards showing that those partial fractions really tend to tan x.\n\nThere is a good summary of other proofs for the irrationality of pi on this wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_π_is_irrational\n\nToday's main t-shirt I got from from Zazzle: \nhttps://www.zazzle.com.au/25_dec_31_oct_t_shirt-235809979886007646\n(there are lots of places that sell \"HO cubed\" t-shirts) \n \nlf you liked this video maybe also consider checking out some of my other videos on irrational and transcendental numbers and on continued fractions and other infinite expressions. The video on continued fractions that I refer to in this video is my video on the most irrational number: https://youtu.be/CaasbfdJdJg\n\nSpecial thanks to my friend Marty Ross for lots of feedback on the slideshow and some good-humoured heckling while we were recording the video.

Featuring close-to-circular shadows of hypercubes, the amazing rhombic dodecahedron, the even more amazing rhombic triacontahedron, Wolfram Alpha's logo and much more. \n\nThe page with my first year hovering-cube assignment lives here: http://www.qedcat.com/misc/cube_assignment.pdf\n\nPretty much everything that is known about the shadow theorem is written up in the following two papers by mathematician Peter McMullen:\n1. Volumes of Projections of unit Cubes, Peter McMullen, Bull London Math. Soc. (1984) 16: 278-280.\n2. Volumes of Complementary Projections of Convex Polytopes, Mh. Math. 104, 265-272 (1987)\n\nJust for the sake of completeness here is a 3d .stl file of the maximal 3d shadow of a 5D hypercube: http://www.qedcat.com/misc/5d.stl  (one reference that talks about it a little bit is Coxeter's classic textbook, Regular polytopes, p. 256, last paragraph).\n\nAs usual thank you very much to Marty Ross and Danil Dimitriev for their help with this video and Michael Franklin for his help with recording this video..\n\nI used  Richard Koch's program Hypersolids for the animation of the spinning 4D hypercube: http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/hypersolids/hypersolids.html\n\nMost of the other animations I programmed in Mathematica. The stills featuring the rhombic triacontahedron were done in Rhino3d, one of my weapons of choice when it comes to preparing files for 3d printing geometrical objects.\n\nВсем любителям математических задачек посвящается!\nКак обещано, русский перевод того задания для первокурсников, которое показано в видео на 13:34-13:53: https://yadi.sk/i/xA4NdOU33LVd4H\n\nEnjoy :)"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M28S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"true","licensedContent":true,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"86158","likeCount":"2687","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"372"}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"w_GzEmS9JZRSZBf1mPWUfJnAgZw","id":"rAHcZGjKVvg","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-07-20T13:50:49Z","channelId":"UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg","title":"The cube shadow theorem (pt.1): Prince Rupert's paradox","description":"In this first part I'll introduce you to an amazing property of cubes that was only discovered around 1985.

The corner piece permutation is always even and can always be solved just using the algorithms derived in the video."},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT18M12S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"true","licensedContent":true,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"502221","likeCount":"6672","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"994"}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"cy3QzF-f0v6iRgtsYQj-JoypFxY","id":"o_D-HsMOYQ8","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2016-05-20T20:36:00Z","channelId":"UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg","title":"Why do mirrors flip left and right but not up and down?","description":"This is a question that people have been puzzling over ever since we discovered mirrors.

Very challenging to get this right since Homer knows close to no math!\n\nHere are a couple of other nice videos on Euler's identity that you may want to check out:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Yi3bT-82O5s (one of our Math in the Simpsons videos)\nhttps://youtu.be/F_0yfvm0UoU   (by 3Blue1Brown)\n\nAnd for those of you who enjoy some mathematical challenges here is your homework assignment on Euler's identity:\n1. How much money does Homer have after Pi years if interest is compounded continuously?\n2. How much money does Homer have after an imaginary Pi number of years?\n3. As we've seen when you let m go to infinity the function (1+x/m)^m turns into the exponential function. In fact, it turns into the infinite series expansion of the exponential function that we used in our previous video. Can you explain why?\n4. Can you explain the e to pi i paradox that we've captured in this video on Mathologer 2: https://youtu.be/Sx5_QGdFmq4.\n\nIf you own Mathematica you can play with this Mathematica notebook that I put together for this video\nhttp://www.qedcat.com/misc/Mathologer_eipi.nb\n\nThank you very much to Danil Dmitriev the official Mathologer translator for Russian for his subtitles.\n\nMerry Christmas!"},"defaultAudioLanguage":"en"},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M47S","dimension":"2d","definition":"hd","caption":"true","licensedContent":true,"contentRating":{},"projection":"rectangular"},"statistics":{"viewCount":"2788179","likeCount":"67185","favoriteCount":"0","commentCount":"3860"}},{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"_-FnQ_k_rBah5fJoFuyyP1Qt4hc","id":"VsQ-OPIZ5kg","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-12-05T23:46:43Z","channelId":"UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg","title":"The mathematical soul of juggling","description":"In this video the Mathologer captures the mathematical soul of juggling and has a lot of fun analysing the hell out of it. \n\nIf you are really keen check out his book and articles on the math of juggling:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/glczdxl\nhttp://tinyurl.com/pryz6fw\nhttp://www.qedcat.com/books.html\n\nThe animations at the end of this video were created a while ago with the free juggling animators Juggle Master and JoePass!

Namely, if you have a continuous parameter you are trying to estimate, the two terms reflect two alternate approaches you can use in comparing hypotheses.

Since the derivative of an exponential should also be an exponential, we could instead run the same test on the logarithms of the differences from day to day, which in this case gives R^2 = 0.91.\n\nWhile this video uses COVID-19 as a motivating example, the main goal is simply a math lesson on exponentials and logistic curves.

Since the derivative of an exponential should also be an exponential, we could instead run the same test on the logarithms of the differences from day to day, which in this case gives R^2 = 0.91.\n\nWhile this video uses COVID-19 as a motivating example, the main goal is simply a math lesson on exponentials and logistic curves.

(By \"allowable\", here, I mean a residue class whose elements are coprime to the modulus, as described in the video).  What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.\n\nDirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vallée Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there.\n\nIn many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.  It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it.  But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann!\n\nMy apologies for the mistake.

See this Mathologer video.\nhttps://youtu.be/CaasbfdJdJg\n\nAlso, if you haven't heard of Ulam Spirals, you may enjoy this Numberphile video:\nhttps://youtu.be/iFuR97YcSLM\n\nDirichlet's paper:\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.1408.pdf\n\nCorrections:\n18:30: In the video, I say that Dirichlet showed that the primes are equally distributed among allowable residue classes, but this is not historically accurate.  (By \"allowable\", here, I mean a residue class whose elements are coprime to the modulus, as described in the video).  What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.\n\nDirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vallée Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there.\n\nIn many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.  It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it.  But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann!\n\nMy apologies for the mistake.

Thanks for the catch!\n\n*Note on conventions:  Throughout this video, I use a single-headed right arrow to represent the horizontal direction.  The standard in quantum mechanics is actually to use double-headed arrows for describing polarization states, while single-headed arrows are typically reserved for the context of spin.\n\nWhat's the difference?  Well, using a double-headed arrow to represent the horizontal direction emphasizes that in a quantum mechanical context, there's no distinction between left and right.

Thanks for the catch!\n\n*Note on conventions:  Throughout this video, I use a single-headed right arrow to represent the horizontal direction.  The standard in quantum mechanics is actually to use double-headed arrows for describing polarization states, while single-headed arrows are typically reserved for the context of spin.\n\nWhat's the difference?  Well, using a double-headed arrow to represent the horizontal direction emphasizes that in a quantum mechanical context, there's no distinction between left and right.  They each have the same measurable state: horizontal (e.g. they pass through horizontally oriented filters).  Once you're in QM, these kets are typically vectors in a more abstract space where vectors are not necessarily spatial directions but instead represent any kind of state.\n\nBecause of how I chose to motivate things with classical waves, where it makes sense for this arrow to represent a unit vector in the right direction, rather than the more abstract idea of a horizontal state vector, I chose to stick with the single-headed notation throughout, though this runs slightly against convention.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

product more deeply, this video shows how it relates to a certain linear transformation via duality.

Thanks to Jane Street. Check out their programs: https://janestreet.com/join-jane-street/our-programs\n\nCheck out Ben Sparks’s campaign video on how the GeoGebra file was made! https://youtu.be/1KQ0NccasRA\n\nAnd here is what you came for, the Harvard github with details on how to send me your effects as a CSV file. https://github.com/GSD6338/XmasTree\n\nIn short: each line of the CSV starts with a frame number and then R, G, B values (one 'column' each) for all of the LEDs in sequence. (You can see examples in the Harvard github.) Send them in by 09 January 2022 either directly on the standupmaths GitHub or email to matt+LEDs@standupmaths.com\n\nYou can get my tree's coordinates in GIFT format as either a CSV:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/lmccfutftplhh3b/coords_2021.csv?dl=0\nOr a TXT file in the old format from last year:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xkb55tzdsxb07m4/coords_2021.txt?dl=0\n\nPlus I've put my auto-correcting code from this video up on my github (along with the GIFT coordinates). https://github.com/standupmaths/xmastree2021\n\nThanks to all of my Patreon supporters who keep my LED habit alive.

The warden places the key under one of the squares, which prisoner 1 sees.  Before he leaves, he must turn over one and only one coin.  Prisoner 2 then walks in and is supposed to be able to figure out which squares the key is in just by looking at the arrangement of coins.\n\nThis is the website Matt mentioned with a full breakdown of the solution and interactive boards you can play with.\nhttp://datagenetics.com/blog/december12014/index.html\n\nCORRECTIONS:\n- At 20:42 when I (Matt) said \"You're now assigning a 64-dimension...\" he meant to say \"You're now assigning a 6-dimension...\".

It's new! I actually think ES-COE-TOID is the most correct.\n- Alex Sweeney noticed that when I describe a prism I say it has rectangle faced sides.
